<p>Describing the different forms Lord Krishna is worshipped in, Param Pujya Dadashri said, Some have labeled Him <q>The One with a flute</q>; some call Him 
    <q>The One with Gopis.</q> But Lord Krishna cannot be fully understood that way.</p>

<p>Beyond the above-mentioned forms, Param Pujya Dadashri explained that Lord Krishna was a manifested God living in continuous awareness and an exalted Self-realized stage; He was a Vasudeva Narayan, a Yogeshwar,
     and one of the 63 Shalaka Purusha (one with super-human abilities and achievements).</p>    
     <p><b>The Essence of the Bhagavad Gita</b></p>
     <p><q>As Arjun's guide on the Mahabharata battlefield,</q> it was Lord Krishna's duty to address his (Arjun's) despondency. In order to do so, the Lord began by revealing His true, divine Self: "Arjun, you have known Me for a long time, yet you haven't known Me in the true sense. What you see before you is My physical body,
         not the true Self. I am separate from this body. I am Atma (the Self).</p>
         <q><b>Material and Packing</b></q>
         <p>Param Pujya Dadashri elaborated that, <q>Lord Krishna said, The material within is precisely what I am - that actually is Krishna.</q> You will find what you are searching for if you recognize Him (beyond the “packing” of the body). 
            The entire inner intent of Shri Krishna is contained within these two words (material and packing).</p>

            <q><b>Atma So Paramatma</b></q>
            <p>It is said that, <q>The real Self is the Absolute Self.</q> What does that mean? Is the real Self Lord Krishna?</p>
            <ul><li>Param Pujya Dadashri explained that, When Shree Krishna says, <q>I am doing this, I am doing that,</q> He is speaking as an embodiment of the Self. People have misunderstood this. People believed Him to be speaking as a mortal but, in actuality, 
                He is speaking as an embodiment of the Self, the immortal.</li></ul> <br>  
                <p><B>What is the Sudarshan Chakra?</B></p>

                <q>Param Pujya Dadashri described that the Sudarshan Chakra (the circular spinning weapon depicted on Lord Krishnas right index finger) represents the Lord's Samyak Darshan (Self Realization, or the vision that I am the Self), 
                    which He had obtained from Tirthankara Lord Neminath.</q>

                      <q> The story of the love of Radha and Krishna is overshadowed by an air of tragedy. The two cannot be together, 
                        as Radha is already married and Krishna has a great destiny ahead of him.</q><br>

                            Radha Krishna - A Never Ending Love Tale
                            The love of Radha and Krishna is immortal, it has no beginning and end. It is beyond the physical world and is spiritual in nature. 
                            It was the pure bond and love that kept both united, not marriage</q></li><br><br>
